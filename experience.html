            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <p>During my college years I worked first in retail industry and then I shifted to work in the hospitality industry. After my degree I kept working in the hospitality industry
                    because I felt that I was not fully prepared and equipped to obtain a job in the web development field. But since I started the TechDegree program
                    at TreeHouse, my perspectives have fully changed. I have found the right tools to be well equipped to enter this vast and wonderful industry
